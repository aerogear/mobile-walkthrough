= Adding Data Sync to your Application with GraphQL

Data Sync is a framework that helps developers build applications that can perform realtime data synchronization with GraphQL.
 
This solution pattern will show you how to:

* Configure and run the link:{showcase-app-link}[{data-sync-showcase-app}] on OpenShift.
* Protect the application's frontend and backend using Red Hat SSO.
* Explore all the capabilities provided by {data-sync-name}.

The following diagram shows the architecture of the {data-sync-showcase-app}:

== Deploying the showcase application

. Navigate to the link:{openshift-host}/console/project/{walkthrough-namespace}/overview[project console, window="_blank"] in OpenShift.
. Click on the *Browse Catalog* button.
. Search the service catalog for 'Data Sync Showcase'.
. Click on the 'Data Sync Showcase' entry to add it to your project.
. Accept all the defaults of the provisioning wizard and click *Create*.
. Check the *Overview* screen of your project and wait until three pods are running:
+
* `ionic-showcase-server` - a Node.js server and client application
* `mosquitto-mqtt-broker` - a message broker
* `postgresql` - a database

You can use the build-in GraphQL playground to interact with the server API. Navigate to the link:{route-ionic-showcase-server-host}/graphql[GraphQL playground, window="_blank"] and remove any text in the left pane of the screen. Paste the following query/mutation into the left pane of the screen:

----
query listTasks {
  allTasks {
    title,
    description,
    id
  }
}

mutation createTask {
  createTask(title: "complete the walkthrough", description: "complete the GraphQL walkthrough") {
    title,
    description,
    version,
    id
  }
}
----

[type=verification]
****
. Click the Run icon in the middle of the playground screen.
. Choose createTask from the menu.
The system should create a task.
. Choose listTasks from the Run menu.
. Check that the following is displayed in the right hand panel:
+
----
{
    "data": {
        "allTasks": [
            {
                "title": "complete the walkthrough",
                "description": "complete the GraphQL walkthrough",
                "id": "1"
            }
        ]
    }
}----
****

[type=verificationFail]

Check the logs of the `ionic-showcase-server` pod.

It should include the string `+connected to messaging service+`.
Verify that you followed each step in the procedure above.  If you are still having issues, contact your administrator.

== Access the client app in a browser

The showcase app demonstrates the key capabilities provided by the {data-sync-name} framework.
It can be run either as a hybrid mobile application, or a Progressive Web App (PWA).

. Go to the link:{route-ionic-showcase-server-host}[newly created client app, window="_blank"]
. Select *Manage Tasks* from the left hand menu.

[type=verification]
****
. Create a task by clicking on the plus icon in the top right-hand side of the screen.
. Add a title and description, of your choosing, to the task and click *Create*.
. Open the link:{route-ionic-showcase-server-host}[tasks section of the client app, window="_blank"] in a different tab.
. Change the status of the task by clicking/unclicking the text box beside the task.
. Verify that the status of the task is synced across all tabs in real-time.

== Protect the showcase app using the Red Hat SSO

In this task, we will protect both the frontend and the backend of the {data-sync-showcase-app} with the {customer-sso-name}.

=== Configure and protect the frontend app

. Make sure you have access to a realm in the link:{sso-realm-url}[{customer-sso-name}, window="_blank"]. If you do not, you can ask your customer-admin user to create one for you. 
. Login to the realm in the link:{sso-realm-url}[{customer-sso-name}, window="_blank"].
. Create a new client for the frontend app:
.. Choose *Clients* under *Configure* in the menu on the left of the screen.
.. Click on the *Create* button on the top-right corner to create a new client.
.. Enter `{user-username}-frontend` for Client ID. Do not change any other fields.
.. Save the client. You should see the *Settings* page of the client.
.. Change `Valid Redirect URIs` to `{route-ionic-showcase-server-host}*`
.. Change `Web Origins` to `*`
.. Click on the *Save* button
.. Click on the *Installation* tab, and select `Keycloak OIDC JSON` format. Copy the content displayed or use the `Download` button to save the configuration file.

. Update the configuration of the frontend app to secure it:
.. Navigate to the link:{openshift-host}/console/project/{walkthrough-namespace}/browse/config-maps[Config Maps page of the OpenShift console].
.. Select the config map that is called `webapp-config`, and edit it by selecting `Edit` under the `Actions` button.
.. Add a new `auth` section to the config map by pasting the content that was copied in the previous step.
.. Rename the `auth-server-url` attribute to `url` and the `resource` attribute to `clientId`.
[type=verification]
****
Does the content of the config map look as follows:
****
[subs="attributes"]
----
   window.showcaseConfig = {
     "backend": {
       "serverUrl": "/graphql",
       "wsServerUrl": ((window.location.protocol === "https:") ? "wss://" : "ws://") + window.location.hostname + "/graphql"
     },
     "auth": {
       "realm": "walkthroughs",
    	 "url": " {user-sso-url}/auth",
   	   "ssl-required": "none",
   	   "clientId": "{user-username}-frontend",
   	   "public-client": true,
   	   "confidential-port": 0
     }
   };

[time=10]

Save it and wait for the app to be re-deployed.

=== Configure and protect the backend app

. Login to the realm in the link:{sso-realm-url}[{customer-sso-name}, window="_blank"].
. Create a new client for the backend:
.. Choose *Clients* under *Configure* in the menu.
.. Click on the *Create* button on the top-right corner to start creating a new client.
.. Enter `{user-username}-server` for Client ID.  Do not change the rest of the fields.
.. Save the client. You should see the *Settings* page of the client.
.. Change the `Access Type` to `bearer-only` and save again.
.. Click on the *Installation* tab, and select `OIDC JSON` format. Copy the content or use the `Download` button to save the configuration file to a directory on the computer.

In order to use the application, we also need to create a few users so that we can login:

. Select *Users* on the left menu, and click on *View all users*.
. Click on *Add user* to create a new user. Pick a username you like for the *Username* field and click *Save*.
. Navigate to `Credentials` tab and set a password for this user. Set `Temporary` option to `OFF`.

Now, we will update the backend to use the downloaded configuration file:
. Navigate to the link:{openshift-host}/console/project/{walkthrough-namespace}/browse/config-maps[Config Maps page of the OpenShift console].
. Click *Create Config Map*.
. When prompted for *Name*, enter:

----
showcase-server-idm-config
----
.. When prompted for *Key*, enter:
+
----
keycloak.json
----
.. For *Value*, click *Browse* and load the `keycloak.json` file that you downloaded previously.
.. Click *Create*. The config map object is created.

.. Choose *Deployments* from the *Applications* menu.

.. Select the deployment config for `ionic-showcase-server`.

.. Click on the *Configuration* tab, and scroll to the *Volumes* section.

.. Click on the *Add Config Files* option at the bottom of the section.

.. Choose the `showcase-server-idm-config` config map as the *Source*.
.. Set the value for *Mount Path* to:
+
----
/tmp/keycloak
----

.. Click *Add* to trigger a new deployment.

.. Click the *Environment* tab and click *Add Value*.
... Set Name to:
+
----
KEYCLOAK_CONFIG
----
... Set Value to:
+
----
/tmp/keycloak/keycloak.json
----
+
Wait for the deployment to complete and the showcase data sync server is running.
