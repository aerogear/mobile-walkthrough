== Deploying the Showcase Data Sync server

You first need to deploy the data sync server of the showcase app.

. Login to the link:{openshift-host}/console[OpenShift Console, window="_blank"]
. Navigate to the link:{openshift-host}/console/project/{walkthrough-namespace}/overview[mobile project, window="_blank"] in OpenShift.
. Click the *Browse Catalog* button.
. Search the service catalog for 'Data Sync Showcase'.

. Click on the 'Data Sync Showcase' entry to add it to your project.

. Accept all the defaults of the provisioning wizard and click *Create*.

. Check the *Overview* screen of your project and wait until three pods are running:
+
* `ionic-showcase-server` - a Node.js app
* `mosquitto-mqtt-broker` - a message broker
* `postgresql` - a database.

. Navigate to the link:{route-ionic-showcase-server-host}/graphql[GraphQL playground, window="_blank"] and remove any text in the left pane of the screen. Paste the following query/mutation into the left pane of the screen:
+
----
query listTasks {
  allTasks {
    title,
    description,
    id
  }
}

mutation createTask {
  createTask(title: "complete the walkthrough", description: "complete the mobile walk through") {
    title,
    description,
    version,
    id
  }
}
----
+
The query and mutation code can be used to verify your environment.

****
. Click the Run icon in the middle of the playground screen.
. Choose createTask from the menu.
The system should create a task.
. Choose listTasks from the Run menu.

// [time=5]
// == View the metrics data of mobile services

// TODO - complete this section once the metrics stack is available



// [time=10]
// == Check the audit logs

// You can use the OpenShift logging feature to see the audit logs that are generated by the syncserver app.

// === Steps

// . Find out the URL of the Kibana dashboard of your OpenShift cluster:
// .. Run the following commands on the bastion server (as root user):
// +
// ----
// oc project openshift-logging
// oc get route
// ----
// +
// .. You should see there is a route called `logging-kibana`. Copy the `Host` value of that route and open it in your browser. You should see the Kibana dashboard page.
// . Filter out the audit log messages in Kibana.
// .. On the `Discover` page, there should be a dropdown you can select on this page. Choose the namespace where the syncserver app is deployed to, and take a look at the messages.
// .. You should see a lot of messages, try expand one and see what the message looks like.
// .. In the `Search` field on the top, enter `tag:AUDIT` and you should be able to see the audit logs generated by the app. If you can't see any message, Navigate to the GraphqQL playground page and execute some queries and then try search again.
// .. [Optional] Follow the steps descibed in link:https://github.com/aerogear/apollo-voyager-server/blob/master/doc/guides/metrics-and-audit-logs.md#importing-kibana-saved-objects:[Importing Kibana Saved Objects guide] and try importing a dashboard template for the sync app, and view the imported dashboard.
