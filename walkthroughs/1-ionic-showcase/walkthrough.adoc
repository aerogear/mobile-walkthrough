== Protect the mobile showcase app by Identity Management service

In this task, you use the Identity Management service to protect both the client and the data sync server.

=== Add Identity Management service to the client app

. Go to the link:{mdc-url}[Mobile Developer Console, window="_blank"].
. Click on the *showcase-app* card to display the configuration screen.
. Click the *Mobile Services* tab.
. Click *Bind to App* for *Identity Management* in the *Unbound Services* section, with the following parameters:
.. Admin User Name: `admin`
.. Admin User Password: `admin`
. Close the wizard. Once the binding process is completed, you should the *Identity Management* row is moved to the `Bound Services` section.
. Go back to the `Configuration` tab of the app and you should see the content of `mobile-services.json` is updated. 
. Copy the content and save it somewhere on the computer.

=== Add Identity Management service to the showcase client and server applications

. Go to the `Mobile Services` tab again and expand the *Identity Management* row. Open the `Keycloak Realm URL` in a new tab.
. Login with username `admin` and password `admin`.
. After the console is loaded, we need to create a new client for the showcase data sync server and add some users for the showcase app:
.. Choose `Configure -> clients` in the menu.
.. Click on the `Create` button on the top-right corner, and create a new client with the following parameters:
... Client ID: `showcase-app-server`
... Do not change the rest of the fields.
.. Save the client. You should see the *Settings* page of the client.
.. Change the `Access Type` to `bearer-only` and save again.
.. Click on the `Installation` tab, and select `Keycloak OIDC JSON` format. Use the `Download` button to save the configuration file to a directory on the computer.
.. Select `Users` on the left menu, and click on `View all users`. You will see there is only 1 admin user in the realm. Click on `Add user` to create new ones. Pick a username you like and save.
.. Go to `Credentials` tab and set a password for this user. Set `Temporary` option to `OFF`.
. Next, we need to update the showcase sync server app to use the downloaded configuration file:
.. Go to the link:{openshift-host}/console/project/{walkthrough-namespace}/browse/config-maps[Config Maps page of the OpenShift console], and click on `Create Config Map`.
.. In the creation form, enter the following values:
... Name: `showcase-server-idm-config`
... Key: `keycloak.json`
... Value: Use the `Browser` button to load the `keycloak.json` file that was downloaded previously.
.. Once the config map object is created, go to `Applications -> Deployments`. Select the deployment config for `ionic-showcase-server`.
.. Click on the *Configuration* tab, and find the `Volumes` section. Click on the `Add Config Files` at the bottom of the section.
... Choose the `showcase-server-idm-config` config map as the *Source*.
... Set the value for *Mount Path* to be `/tmp/keycloak`.
... Click on `Add`. This will trigger a new deployment.
.. Go to the *Environment* tab of the deployment config, and add a new environment variable:
... Name: `KEYCLOAK_CONFIG`
... Value: `/tmp/keycloak/keycloak.json`
.. Wait for the deployment to complete and the showcase data sync server is running.
. Navigate to the link:{route-ionic-showcase-server-host}/graphql[GraphQL playground, window="_blank"] page again and refresh the page. This time you should get an `Access Denied` error. This is because the endpoint is now protected by Keycloak and requires user authentication.

=== Update the config of the showcase client app and run it

. Go to link:{che-url}[CodeReady Console, window="_blank"] and open the workspace for the showcase app that we have created in one of the previous steps.
. Open `src/mobile-services.json` in the CodeReady editor and replace it with the updated version from the Mobile Developer Console.
. Execute the `build` and `serve` commands again. Open the URL in a browser tab and this time you will be presented with a login page.
. Login with the user credentials you have created, and you should be able to continue using the app. Try create more tasks and see if it works.

== Exploring data sync features using the showcase app

In oder to use the showcase app to explore data sync features, it's best to run the multiple instances of the app using different browsers. You can run it in a browser on a mobile device if you have one. 

image::images/showcase.png[showcase, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

=== Real time sync 

. Select one instance of the app and open side panel 
. Select `Manage Tasks`.
. Create a new task using `+` icon.
. Put any information into the New Task view and click on the create button
. Check other instances of the app and you should see the same task appear.
. Make some changes to the task in any instance of the app, and you should see the all the changes are automatically synced across all instances.

=== Offline Support

. In order to demo the offline feature, we need to get the device into offline mode first.
.. On a mobile phone this can be done by turning on airplane mode. 
.. In a browser you can use the developer tool to simulate offline mode (For example, in Chrome, you can open it by pressing F12, or using Command+Option+I on macOS. Select the `Network` tab, and check `Offline`).
. Create a new task in the showcase app. The task should be created and the `Offline Changes` button in the footer should contain one change.
. Try make a few more changes by either editing existing tasks, or creating new ones.
. You can review all the changes you have made while offline directly by clicking on `Offline Changes` button.
. Check other instances of the app and you will not see any of the changes you have made because the current one is offline.
. Restore connectivity, and once the client is online again, you should see all `Offline Changes` are synced to the server and appearing in other instances of the showcase app.

=== Conflict resolution

. Make sure there are 2 instances of the app running.
. In both instances of the app:
.. Go offline
.. Make changes on name and description fields for the same tasks on two separate clients
. Bring both of them back online again. You will see a popup showing up in the last instance that is back online warning about conflicts.
. Go offline on both clients
. Make changes on the name field on first client and description on the second one 
. Bring both of them back online again. You should see changes merged on both clients automatically without conflict popup

// [time=5]
// == View the metrics data of mobile services

// TODO - complete this section once the metrics stack is available



// [time=10]
// == Check the audit logs

// You can use the OpenShift logging feature to see the audit logs that are generated by the syncserver app.

// === Steps

// . Find out the URL of the Kibana dashboard of your OpenShift cluster:
// .. Run the following commands on the bastion server (as root user):
// +
// ----
// oc project openshift-logging
// oc get route
// ----
// +
// .. You should see there is a route called `logging-kibana`. Copy the `Host` value of that route and open it in your browser. You should see the Kibana dashboard page.
// . Filter out the audit log messages in Kibana. 
// .. On the `Discover` page, there should be a dropdown you can select on this page. Choose the namespace where the syncserver app is deployed to, and take a look at the messages.
// .. You should see a lot of messages, try expand one and see what the message looks like.
// .. In the `Search` field on the top, enter `tag:AUDIT` and you should be able to see the audit logs generated by the app. If you can't see any message, go to the GraphqQL playground page and execute some queries and then try search again.
// .. [Optional] Follow the steps descibed in link:https://github.com/aerogear/apollo-voyager-server/blob/master/doc/guides/metrics-and-audit-logs.md#importing-kibana-saved-objects:[Importing Kibana Saved Objects guide] and try importing a dashboard template for the sync app, and view the imported dashboard.
