= Running the mobile showcase application with {mobile-services-name}

This Solution pattern demonstrates running the GraphQL PWA Showcase Application using Red Hat Mobile Developer Services.

It will show you how to:

* Build and run the link:{showcase-app-link}[Ionic based GraphQL Client app].
* Deploy the data sync server of the GraphQL Showcase app.
* Protect the showcase GraphQL app and the backend service using the Red Hat SSO.

It will also introduce you to all features offered by the AeroGear Data Sync framework.

== Deploying the Showcase Data Sync server

You first need to deploy the data sync server of the showcase app.

. Login to the link:{openshift-host}/console[OpenShift Console, window="_blank"]
. Navigate to the link:{openshift-host}/console/project/{walkthrough-namespace}/overview[mobile project, window="_blank"] in OpenShift.
. Click the *Browse Catalog* button.
. Search the service catalog for 'Data Sync Showcase'.

. Click on the 'Data Sync Showcase' entry to add it to your project.

. Accept all the defaults of the provisioning wizard and click *Create*.

. Check the *Overview* screen of your project and wait until three pods are running:
+
* `ionic-showcase-server` - a Node.js app
* `mosquitto-mqtt-broker` - a message broker
* `postgresql` - a database.

. Navigate to the link:{route-ionic-showcase-server-host}/graphql[GraphQL playground, window="_blank"] and remove any text in the left pane of the screen. Paste the following query/mutation into the left pane of the screen:
+
----
query listTasks {
  allTasks {
    title,
    description,
    id
  }
}

mutation createTask {
  createTask(title: "complete the walkthrough", description: "complete the GraphQL walkthrough") {
    title,
    description,
    version,
    id
  }
}
----
+
The query and mutation code can be used to verify your environment.

== Protect the mobile showcase app using the Identity Management service

In this task, you use the Identity Management service to protect both the client (PWA) and the data sync server.

=== Add Identity Management service to the client app (PWA) and create a realm for users

. As your admin to create new realm for your user and obtain url to be able to login to the keycloak instance
. In new realm we going to create two new clients - one for server side and one for the client side application.
. Open URL obtained from adminstrator

. Navigate to the project config-maps section {openshift-host}/console/project/{walkthrough-namespace}/browse/config-maps
. Select `webapp-config`
. Add new `auth` section in config by utilizing the config that was copied in previous step.
. In configuration replace `auth-server-url` to `url` and `resource` to `clientId`
. Configuration should look as follows

---
    window.showcaseConfig = {
      "backend": {
        "serverUrl": "/graphql",
        "wsServerUrl": ((window.location.protocol === "https:") ? "wss://" : "ws://") + window.location.hostname + "/graphql"
      }
      "auth": {
        "realm": "your realm",
        "url": "https://your-server/auth",
        "clientId": "your-client"
      }
    };
---

. Save and wait for server to redeploy


=== Configure Identity Management service for the showcase client applications
