= Adding Data Sync to your application with GraphQL

Data Sync is a framework that helps developers build applications that can perform realtime data synchronization with GraphQL.
 
This solution pattern will show you how to:

* Configure and run the link:{showcase-app-link}[{data-sync-showcase-app}] on OpenShift.
* Explore all the capabilities provided by {data-sync-name}.

The following diagram shows the architecture of the {data-sync-showcase-app}:

== Deploying the Data Sync showcase application

. Navigate to the link:{openshift-host}/console/project/{walkthrough-namespace}/overview[project console, window="_blank"] in OpenShift.
. Click on the *Browse Catalog* button.
. Search the service catalog for 'Data Sync Showcase'.
. Click on the 'Data Sync Showcase' entry to add it to your project.
. Accept all the defaults of the provisioning wizard and click *Create*.
. Check the *Overview* screen of your project and wait until three pods are running:
+
* `ionic-showcase-server` - a Node.js server and client application
* `mosquitto-mqtt-broker` - a message broker
* `postgresql` - a database
+
Once the pods are running, you can use the GraphQL playground to interact with the server API as described in the next step.

. Navigate to the link:{route-ionic-showcase-server-host}/graphql[GraphQL playground, window="_blank"] and replace the text in the left pane of the screen with the following query and mutation:

----
query listTasks {
  allTasks {
    title,
    description,
    id
  }
}

mutation createTask {
  createTask(title: "complete the walkthrough", description: "complete the GraphQL walkthrough") {
    title,
    description,
    version,
    id
  }
}
----

. Click the Run icon in the middle of the playground screen.
. Choose createTask from the menu.
The system should create a task.
. Choose listTasks from the Run menu.
. Check that the following is displayed in the right hand panel:
+
----
{
    "data": {
        "allTasks": [
            {
                "title": "complete the walkthrough",
                "description": "complete the GraphQL walkthrough",
                "id": "1"
            }
        ]
    }
}
